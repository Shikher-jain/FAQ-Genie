    {
      "Q": "What is PostgreSQL?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL is an object-relational database system that has the features of traditional proprietary database systems with enhancements to be found in next-generation DBMS systems. PostgreSQL is free and the complete source code is available. PostgreSQL development is performed by a team of mostly volunteer developers spread throughout the world and communicating via the Internet. It is a community project and is not controlled by any company."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How is it pronounced?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL is pronounced Post-Gres-Q-L."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is Postgres?",
      "A": "Postgres is a widely-used nickname for PostgreSQL. It was the original name of the project at Berkeley and is strongly preferred over other nicknames. If you find 'PostgreSQL' hard to pronounce, call it 'Postgres' instead."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who controls PostgreSQL?",
      "A": "If you are looking for a PostgreSQL gatekeeper, central committee, or controlling company, give up --- there isn't one. We do have a core committee and git committers, but these groups are more for administrative purposes than control. The project is directed by the community of developers and users, which anyone can join. All you need to do is subscribe to the mailing lists and participate in the discussions."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who is the PostgreSQL Global Development Group?",
      "A": "The \"PGDG\" is an international, unincorporated association of individuals and companies who have contributed to the PostgreSQL project.  The PostgreSQL Core Team generally act as spokespeople for the PGDG."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Who is the PostgreSQL Core Team?",
      "A": "The core team members are senior contributors to PostgreSQL who perform specific roles for the project."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What about the various PostgreSQL foundations?",
      "A": "While the PostgreSQL project utilizes non-profit corporations in the USA, Europe, Brazil and Japan for fundraising and project coordination, these entities do not own the PostgreSQL code."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the license of PostgreSQL?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL is distributed under a license similar to BSD and MIT. Basically, it allows users to do anything they want with the code, including reselling binaries without the source code. The only restriction is that you not hold us legally liable for problems with the software. There is also the requirement that this copyright appear in all copies of the software."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What platforms does PostgreSQL support?",
      "A": "In general, any modern Unix-compatible platform should be able to run PostgreSQL. The platforms that have received recent explicit testing can be seen in the Build farm . PostgreSQL also runs natively on Microsoft Windows NT-based operating systems like Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 2003, 2008, etc. Cygwin builds for Windows exist but are generally not recommended; use the native Windows builds instead."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Where can I get PostgreSQL?",
      "A": "There are binary distributions for various operating systems and platforms; see our download area . The source code can be obtained via web browser or through ftp ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the most recent release?",
      "A": "The latest release of PostgreSQL is shown on the front page of our website . We typically have a major release every year, with minor releases every few months."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Where can I get support?",
      "A": "The PostgreSQL community provides assistance to many of its users via email. For best results, consider reading the guide to reporting problems before you post to make sure you include enough information for people to help you. The major IRC channel is #postgresql on Libera (irc.libera.chat)."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I submit a bug report?",
      "A": "Visit the PostgreSQL bug form to submit your bug report to the pgsql-bugs mailing list. For a prompt and helpful response, it is important for you to read the guide to reporting problems to make sure that you include the information required to fully understand and act on your report."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I find out about known bugs or missing features?",
      "A": "See our TODO list for known bugs, missing features, and future plans."
    },
    {
      "Q": "A bug I'm encountering is fixed in a newer minor release of PostgreSQL, but I don't want to upgrade. Can I get a patch for just this issue?",
      "A": "No. Nobody will make a custom patch for you so you can (say) extract a fix from 8.4.3 and apply it to 8.4.1 . That's because there should never be any need to do so. If you really feel you have to do this you will need to extract the patch from the sources yourself."
    },
    {
      "Q": "I have a program that says it wants PostgreSQL x.y.1. Can I use PostgreSQL x.y.2 instead?",
      "A": "Any program that works with a particular version, like 8.4.1, should work with any other minor version in the same major version. That means that if a program says it wants (eg) 8.4.1, you can and should install the latest in the 8.4 series instead."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What documentation is available?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL includes extensive documentation, including a large manual, manual pages, and some test examples. There are a number of PostgreSQL books available for purchase; two of them are also available online."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How can I learn SQL?",
      "A": "First, consider the PostgreSQL-specific books mentioned above. Many of our users also like The Practical SQL Handbook, Bowman, Judith S., et al., Addison-Wesley. Others like The Complete Reference SQL, Groff et al., McGraw-Hill."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I submit a patch or join the development team?",
      "A": "See the Developer's FAQ."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does PostgreSQL compare to other DBMSs?",
      "A": "There are several ways of measuring software: features, performance, reliability, support, and price."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Can PostgreSQL be embedded?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL is designed as a client/server architecture, which requires separate processes for each client and server, and various helper processes. Many embedded architectures can support such requirements. However, if your embedded architecture requires the database server to run inside the application process, you cannot use Postgres and should select a lighter-weight database solution."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I unsubscribe from the PostgreSQL email lists?",
      "A": "The PostgreSQL Majordomo page allows subscribing or unsubscribing from any of the PostgreSQL email lists."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I avoid receiving duplicate emails?",
      "A": "All PostgreSQL email lists are configured so a group reply goes to the email list and the original email author. If you would prefer not to receive duplicate email from the list in cases where you already receive an email directly, check eliminatecc from the Majordomo Change Settings page."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What interfaces are available for PostgreSQL?",
      "A": "The core PostgreSQL source code includes only the C and embedded C interfaces. All other interfaces are independent projects that are downloaded separately."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What tools are available for using PostgreSQL with Web pages?",
      "A": "For Web integration, PHP is an excellent interface. For complex cases, many use the Perl and DBD::Pg with CGI.pm or mod_perl."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does PostgreSQL have a graphical user interface?",
      "A": "There are a large number of GUI Tools that are available for PostgreSQL from both proprietary and open source developers."
    },
    {
      "Q": "When installing from source code, how do I install PostgreSQL somewhere other than /usr/local/pgsql?",
      "A": "Specify the --prefix option when running configure."
    },
    {
      "Q": "I'm installing PostgreSQL on Windows or OS X and don't know the password for the postgres user",
      "A": "Dave Page wrote a blog post explaining what the different passwords are used for, and how to overcome common problems such as resetting them."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I control connections from other hosts?",
      "A": "By default, PostgreSQL only allows connections from the local machine using Unix domain sockets or TCP/IP connections. Other machines will not be able to connect unless you modify listen_addresses in the postgresql.conf file, enable host-based authentication by modifying the $PGDATA/pg_hba.conf file, and restart the database server."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I tune the database engine for better performance?",
      "A": "There are three major areas for potential performance improvement: Query Changes, Server Configuration, and Hardware Selection."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What debugging features are available?",
      "A": "There are many log_* server configuration variables that enable printing of query and process statistics which can be very useful for debugging and performance measurements."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why do I get \"Sorry, too many clients\" when trying to connect?",
      "A": "You have reached the default limit of 100 database sessions. See Number of database connections for advice on whether you should raise the connection limit or add a connection pooler."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the upgrade process for PostgreSQL?",
      "A": "See for a general discussion about upgrading, and for specific instructions on upgrading a PostgreSQL cluster."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Will PostgreSQL handle recent daylight saving time changes in various countries?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL releases 8.0 and up depend on the widely-used tzdata database for daylight savings information. To deal with a DST law change that affects you, install a new tzdata file set and restart the server."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What computer hardware should I use?",
      "A": "Because PC hardware is mostly compatible, people tend to believe that all PC hardware is of equal quality. It is not. ECC RAM, good quality hard drives/SSDs, reliable power supplies, and quality motherboards are more reliable and have better performance than less expensive hardware."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How does PostgreSQL use CPU resources?",
      "A": "The PostgreSQL server is process-based (not threaded). Each database session connects to a single PostgreSQL operating system (OS) process. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the OS."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why does PostgreSQL have so many processes, even when idle?",
      "A": "As noted in the answer above, PostgreSQL is process based, so it starts one postgres (or postgres.exe on Windows) instance per connection. The postmaster (which accepts connections and starts new postgres instances for them) is always running. In addition, PostgreSQL generally has one or more \"helper\" processes like the stats collector, background writer, autovacuum daemon, walsender, etc, all of which show up as \"postgres\" instances in most system monitoring tools."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why does PostgreSQL use so much memory?",
      "A": "Despite appearances, this is absolutely normal, and there's actually nowhere near as much memory being used as tools like top or the Windows process monitor say PostgreSQL is using. Tools like top and the Windows process monitor may show many postgres instances (see above), each of which appears to use a huge amount of memory."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I SELECT only the first few rows of a query?",
      "A": "To retrieve only a few rows, if you know at the number of rows needed at the time of the SELECT use LIMIT. If you don't know the number of rows at SELECT time, use a cursor and FETCH."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I find out what tables, indexes, databases, and users are defined?",
      "A": "Use the \\dt command to see tables in psql. For a complete list of commands inside psql you can use \\?. Alternatively you can read the source code for psql in file pgsql/src/bin/psql/describe.c"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do you change a column's data type?",
      "A": "Changing the data type of a column can be done easily in 8.0 and later with ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN TYPE."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the maximum size for a row, a table, and a database?",
      "A": "These are the limits: Maximum size for a database? unlimited (32 TB databases exist)\nMaximum size for a table? 32 TB\nMaximum size for a row? 400 GB\nMaximum size for a field? 1 GB\nMaximum number of rows in a table? unlimited\nMaximum number of columns in a table? 250-1600 depending on column types\nMaximum number of indexes on a table? unlimited"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How much database disk space is required to store data from a typical text file?",
      "A": "A PostgreSQL database may require up to five times the disk space to store data from a text file."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why are my queries slow?",
      "A": "Indexes are essential to PostgreSQL and are typically used to increase database performance. Still, indexes mean additional overhead to database systems, which means they should be applied reasonably."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I see how the query optimizer is evaluating my query?",
      "A": "This is done with the EXPLAIN command; see Using EXPLAIN."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I change the sort ordering of textual data?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL sorts textual data according to the ordering that is defined by the current locale, which is selected during initdb."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I perform regular expression searches and case-insensitive regular expression searches?",
      "A": "The ~ operator does regular expression matching, and ~* does case-insensitive regular expression matching. The case-insensitive variant of LIKE is called ILIKE."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I use an index for case-insensitive searches?",
      "A": "If you create an expression index on \"lower(col)\", it will be used: CREATE INDEX tabindex ON tab (lower(col));"
    },
    {
      "Q": "In a query, how do I detect if a field is NULL?",
      "A": "You can test the value with IS NULL or IS NOT NULL, like this: SELECT * FROM tab WHERE col IS NULL;"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I concatenate possible NULLs?",
      "A": "Concatenating a NULL with something else produces another NULL. If that's not what you want, you can replace the NULL(s) using COALESCE(), like this: SELECT COALESCE(col1, '') || COALESCE(col2, '') FROM tab;"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How can I sort on whether a field is NULL or not?",
      "A": "To sort by the NULL status, use an IS NULL or IS NOT NULL test in your ORDER BY clause. Things that are true will sort higher than things that are false, so the following will put NULL entries at the front of the output: SELECT * FROM tab ORDER BY (col IS NOT NULL), col;"
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is the difference between the various character types?",
      "A": "Type\tInternal Name\tNotes\nVARCHAR(n)\tvarchar\tsize specifies maximum length, no padding\nCHAR(n)\tbpchar\tblank-padded to the specified fixed length\nTEXT\ttext\tno specific upper limit on length\nBYTEA\tbytea\tvariable-length byte array (null-byte safe)\n\"char\" (with the quotes)\tchar\tone byte"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I create a serial/auto-incrementing field?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL supports a SERIAL data type. Actually, this isn't quite a real type. It's a shorthand for creating an integer column that is fed from a sequence."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I get the value of a SERIAL insert?",
      "A": "The simplest way is to retrieve the assigned SERIAL value with RETURNING. Using the example table in the previous question, it would look like this: INSERT INTO person (name) VALUES ('Blaise Pascal') RETURNING id;"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Doesn't currval() lead to a race condition with other users?",
      "A": "No. currval() returns the latest sequence value assigned by your session, independently of what is happening in other sessions."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why are there gaps in the numbering of my sequence/SERIAL column?",
      "A": "To improve concurrency, sequence values are given out to running transactions on-demand; the sequence object is not kept locked but is immediately available for another transaction to get another sequence value."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is an OID?",
      "A": "If a table is created WITH OIDS, each row includes an OID column that is automatically filled in during INSERT. OIDs are sequentially assigned 4-byte integers. Initially they are unique across the entire installation. However, the OID counter wraps around at 4 billion, and after that OIDs may be duplicated."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What is a CTID?",
      "A": "CTIDs identify specific physical rows by their block and offset positions within a table. They are used by index entries to point to physical rows. A logical row's CTID changes when it is updated, so the CTID cannot be used as a long-term row identifier."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why do I get the error \"ERROR: Memory exhausted in AllocSetAlloc()\"?",
      "A": "You probably have run out of virtual memory on your system, or your kernel has a low limit for certain resources. Try this before starting the server: ulimit -d 262144 limit datasize 256m"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I tell what PostgreSQL version I am running?",
      "A": "Run this query: SELECT version();"
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is there a way to leave an audit trail of database operations?",
      "A": "There's nothing built-in, but it's not too difficult to build such facilities yourself."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I create a column that will default to the current time?",
      "A": "Use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP: CREATE TABLE test (x int, modtime TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );"
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I perform an outer join?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL supports outer joins using the SQL standard syntax."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I perform queries using multiple databases?",
      "A": "While there is no way to directly query a database other than the current one, there are several approaches to the issue, some of which are described below."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I return multiple rows or columns from a function?",
      "A": "It is easy using set-returning functions."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why do I get \"relation with OID ##### does not exist\" errors when accessing temporary tables in PL/PgSQL functions?",
      "A": "In PostgreSQL versions < 8.3, PL/PgSQL caches function scripts, and an unfortunate side effect is that if a PL/PgSQL function accesses a temporary table, and that table is later dropped and recreated, and the function called again, the function will fail because the cached function contents still point to the old temporary table."
    },
    {
      "Q": "What replication solutions are available?",
      "A": "Though \"replication\" is a single term, there are several technologies for doing replication, with advantages and disadvantages for each."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Is possible to create a shared-storage postgresql server cluster?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL does not support clustering using shared storage on a SAN, SCSI backplane, iSCSI volume, or other shared media."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why are my table and column names not recognized in my query?",
      "A": "The most common cause of unrecognized names is the use of double-quotes around table or column names during table creation."
    },
    {
      "Q": "I lost the database password. What can I do to recover it?",
      "A": "You can't. However, you can reset it to something else."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Does PostgreSQL have stored procedures?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL doesn't. However PostgreSQL have very powerful functions and user-defined functions capabilities that can do most things that other RDBMS stored routines (procedures and functions) can do and in many cases more."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why don't BEGIN, ROLLBACK and COMMIT work in stored procedures/functions?",
      "A": "PostgreSQL doesn't support autonomous transactions in its stored functions. Like all PostgreSQL queries, stored functions always run in a transaction and cannot operate outside a transaction."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why is \"SELECT count(*) FROM bigtable;\" slow?",
      "A": "In 9.2 and above it generally isn't thanks to Index-only scans."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why is my query much slower when run as a prepared query?",
      "A": "In PostgreSQL 9.2 and above this issue is rare because PostgreSQL can decide to use a generic or value-optimised plan on a per-execution basis."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why is my query much slower when run in a function than standalone?",
      "A": "See FAQ#Why is my query much slower when run as a prepared query? Queries in PL/PgSQL functions are prepared and cached, so they execute in much the same way as if you'd PREPARE d then EXECUTE d the query yourself."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why do my strings sort incorrectly?",
      "A": "First, make sure you are using the locale you want to be using. Use SHOW lc_collate to show the database-wide locale in effect."
    },
    {
      "Q": "Why doesn't PostgreSQL report a column not found error when using the wrong name in a subquery?",
      "A": "In the above query you will select both rows from tblA even though you are expecting only the row with id = 2 to be selected."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I prevent regular users from seeing my trade secrets?",
      "A": "You don't. The system catalog does not take part in the grant/revoke based privileges system; any user with a login to a database can view the contents of the system catalog."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I encrypt my data?",
      "A": "First, see Bruce Momjian's presentation on the general subject of data protection. Also see [GENERAL] Re: Two-way encryption as a starting point. Consider whether you need something like automatically-encrypted types."

      "Q": "Where is the Oops message located?",
      "A": "Normally, the Oops text is read from the kernel buffers by klogd and handed to syslogd, which writes it to a syslog file (typically /var/log/messages). On systems with systemd, it may also be stored by the journald daemon and accessed using the journalctl command. If klogd dies, you can run `dmesg > file` or `cat /proc/kmsg > file` (but you must interrupt the transfer). If the machine crashed completely, you can hand-copy the text, take a picture of the screen, or boot with a higher resolution (vga=791, needs vesafb) or serial console to capture the output on a second machine."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I find the bug's location?",
      "A": "To find the bug's location in the Kernel source file, you can use gdb (best with a kernel pre-compiled with debug info) or objdump.  Gdb allows you to translate the EIP value from the Oops message to a file and line number. If you don't have CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO, use the function offset from the Oops.  Objdump helps locate the code based on a hex offset from the crash output; assembler code will be shown, or C code if debug symbols are enabled.  For a call trace, find the relevant module using gdb, e.g., `gdb fs/jbd/jbd.ko`."
    },
    {
      "Q": "How do I report a bug?",
      "A": "To report a bug upstream, identify the bug tracker or mailing list using `./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --bug -f <path/to/file>`. This script points to the last developers who touched the code, the driver maintainer, the subsystem maintainer, and relevant mailing lists (e.g., linux-media@vger.kernel.org, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org). If bug reporting URIs are listed, prefer them over email; otherwise, report to the development mailing list, copying the driver maintainer. If unsure, send it to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org."

      "Q": "How do I fix a bug?",

    },
    {
      "Q": "What are the notes on Oops tracing with klogd?",
      "A": "For full support in klogd for processing protection faults and address resolution, use at least version 1.3-pl3 of the sysklogd package. Klogd performs static translation (using System.map) and dynamic translation (for kernel modules).  A patch included with sysklogd modifies modules-2.0.0 to automatically signal klogd when modules are loaded/unloaded for seamless debugging of protection faults in kernel modules."
